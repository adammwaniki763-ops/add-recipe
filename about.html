      <h1>About Recipe Keeper</h1>
      
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Recipe Keeper is dedicated to helping home cooks digitize and organize their favorite recipes in one beautiful, easy-to-use place. We believe that recipes are more than just instructions—they're stories, memories, and culinary traditions worth preserving.</p>

      <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
      <p>Traditional recipe cards and cookbooks are wonderful, but they're not searchable, shareable, or accessible from every device. We created Recipe Keeper to bridge that gap: a personal recipe management app that combines the warmth of a handwritten cookbook with the convenience of modern technology.</p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul class="features-list">
        <li><strong>Save Your Recipes:</strong> Add unlimited recipes with ingredients, instructions, and images</li>
        <li><strong>Organize by Category:</strong> Tag recipes to keep them organized</li>
        <li><strong>Quick Access:</strong> View all your recipes in a beautiful grid</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your recipes stay on your device—no accounts needed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
      <p>We designed Recipe Keeper with a modern editorial aesthetic inspired by beautiful cookbooks. Warm colors, elegant typography, and generous whitespace make cooking feel like a creative, personal ritual. Every element is intentional and curated, just like flipping through a beautifully designed cookbook.</p>
